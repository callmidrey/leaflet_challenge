This is my Module 15 Challenge

# Earthquake Data Visualization
This project fetches earthquake data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) API and visualizes it on a web map using Leaflet.js. The earthquake data is retrieved in GeoJSON format and displayed as markers on the map, with each marker representing an earthquake event. Additionally, the magnitude and location of each earthquake are displayed in pop-up windows when a marker is clicked. A sneak peak is included below:

# Features
Fetches earthquake data from the USGS API.
Displays earthquake events as markers on a Leaflet map.
Provides pop-up windows with detailed information for each earthquake marker.
Generates a legend indicating the depth ranges of earthquakes.

# Technologies Used
JavaScript
D3.js (Data-Driven Documents)
Leaflet.js

# Usage
Upon opening the web page, earthquake data will be fetched from the USGS API and displayed on the map. You can interact with the map by zooming in/out and clicking on individual earthquake markers to view additional information.

# Code Structure
The folder Starter code contains the following: 
- index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the web page.
- app.js: JavaScript file responsible for fetching earthquake data, creating features (markers) on the map, and generating the legend.
- style.css: Contains CSS styles for styling the web page elements.

# Acknowledgments
Tom, Jordan and the bootcamp team of instructors for insightful codes.
USGS (United States Geological Survey) for providing earthquake data through their API.
Leaflet.js and D3.js communities for their excellent libraries and documentation.
